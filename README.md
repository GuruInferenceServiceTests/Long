Long is a forked version of Ghidra that is not officially supported as it is only a community version.

The goal of this project is to allow faster prototyping with more experimental features and for more fluent user experience. Current Ghidra has many "not so intuitional" choices, and that's what we want to change.

As for the name, Long means Dragon in Chinese, can be pronounced more like "lown".

Some of the decisions are still yet to made, including how to manage this project as it will definitely emerge along with the community. With small community as for now, nothing needs to be done to manage it anyway. :P

# Roadmap

Current Roadmap is to find out those influent user experiences and change from the easier ones. Github project may be used to denote what we want to change.

# Contributors

We follow [official Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra), that makes them the main contributors.

Members from [Team r3kapig](https://github.com/r3kapig) are currently handling those changes deviating from main repo.
